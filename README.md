# FFT Implementation for Real-Time Frequency Identifier (RTFI) Analyzer

Welcome to the FFT_for_RTFI_analyzer repository. This repository contains a personalized implementation of the Goertzel algorithm, designed to be used alongside the Polyphonic Pitch Detector algorithm available on my GitHub profile.

## Purpose and Overview

The main goal of this implementation is to provide a robust and efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for real-time frequency analysis. The Goertzel algorithm, a specialized form of the FFT, is utilized here to accurately identify and analyze the frequencies present in audio signals. This implementation complements the Polyphonic Pitch Detector algorithm by enhancing the accuracy and reliability of frequency identification.

## Getting Started

To execute the code, you can use the `start.sh` script provided in the repository. This script sets up the environment and initiates the execution process. For a visual guide on how to run the code, you can watch the demonstration video at the following link: [Execution Demonstration](https://youtu.be/lKG4bw3VCMw).

## Usage and Integration

The FFT implementation in this repository can be seamlessly integrated with the Polyphonic Pitch Detector algorithm available on my GitHub profile. By combining these two algorithms, you can create a comprehensive real-time frequency analysis tool for audio signals.
